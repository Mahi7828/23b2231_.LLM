## 1.Basics of Machine Learning
#### Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models enabling computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, ML systems learn from and make decisions based on data. The primary goal of ML is to allow computers to learn and adapt through experience, improving their performance over time. ML is utilized in various applications, from recommendation systems and image recognition to autonomous vehicles and natural language processing, making it a crucial technology in today's data-driven world.

## 2.Types of Machine Learning
### Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Each type serves different purposes and is chosen based on the nature of the task and the available data. You can just read ahead to know more about each of them.

### 2.1 Supervised Learning
#### In supervised learning, the algorithm is given a dataset containing inputs and their corresponding correct outputs. The main objective is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, which can then be used to predict the output of new, unseen inputs. For example, in a supervised learning task to classify emails as spam or not spam, the algorithm would be trained on a dataset labeled as "spam" or "not spam" and then used to classify new emails.

### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning
#### Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. For instance, in customer segmentation, unsupervised learning can group customers based on purchasing behavior without pre-labeled categories. Clustering algorithms, such as k-means, and dimensionality reduction techniques, like PCA, are commonly used in unsupervised learning.

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning
#### Reinforcement learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent learns to behave in an environment, performing actions and receiving rewards. The agent's objective is to maximize its total reward. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is dynamic and focuses on the sequence of actions rather than static data. Applications include training AI to play games, where the agent improves its strategy by learning from the outcomes of its moves.
